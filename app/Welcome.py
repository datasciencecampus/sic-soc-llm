    1. **SIC & SOC pre-defined coding assistant**

    Enter respondent data into the input fields and press the validate button.
    The response and debugging info will be displayed below.
    Preloaded classification indices are used.

    2. **Setup custom LLM coding assistant**

    You can customise your own classification assistant by uploading your own index and
    specifying survey fields. This will be used in a Retrieval Augmented
    Generation (RAG) pipeline.

    3. **Test custom LLM coding assistant**

    After setting up a custom index and survey fields, you can test
    your custom LLM coding assistant.
